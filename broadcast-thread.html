    {% header h2 | What problem does this solve? %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">When people talk on a thread I haven't interacted with (and especially if the original message is outside the main window) I can't really tell that a conversation is happening at all. This plugin makes it as if all the people talking on your current channel chose to send their threaded messages to the channel.</p>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Won't this be too noisy? %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">It all depends on the folks on your team. This plugin is disabled by default, to avoid messing up with folks' workflows.</p>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | If I go to another channel and then go back, I don't see the broadcasted messages %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Yes, by the way Slack works I can't make it be consistent. The best workaround I can offer is to keep multiple channels on multiple tabs if you really want to be up to date with several channels' threads messages :shrug:. I wish the good folks at Slack implemented this themselves.</p>
