<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Move reactions to the right %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Reactions can take some vertical space, increasing the scroll you have to do to actually see what's going on. With this feature, Slack now looks like this:</p>
    <img src="/assets/images/moveReactions.png" />
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Disable status emojis %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Do you find the status emojis distracting? You can disable them!</p>
    <img src="/assets/images/hideStatusEmoji.gif" />
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Move the sidebar to the right %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Why? Because you can! here's how it looks:</p>
    <img src="/assets/images/moveSidebar.png" />
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Hide All Unreads from the sidebar %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">I can see what's unread... I don't use All Unreads at all.</p>
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Hide All Threads from the sidebar %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Same thing... I don't need all threads at all.</p>
</section>
