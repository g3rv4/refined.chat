    {% header h2 | Why would you like to mute somebody? %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Sometimes bots get in the middle of what I want to use Slack for, and when I get back to our channel after an hour doing coding, I need to scroll a lot to see what people have been talking about in my absence.</p>
    <p class="stacks-copy">The funny thing is that most of that are bots. Bots that other people on the team find useful, just that in my case, I'd rather have a clean view of actual people's conversations.</p>
