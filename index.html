<p class="stacks-copy">Here's a quick list of all the features. Follow the links for details on what they do :) Originally, I recorded a video showing the extension, but keeping it updated was really challenging.</p>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Mute users %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Do you have some noisy bots you'd like to mute? <a href="/mute-users">Taut lets you do that</a>.</p>
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Use markdown links %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">You can write things like <span class="ff-mono">[Check this amazing extension](https://taut.rocks)</span> and that's going to appear as <a href="https://taut.rocks">Check this amazing extension</a> for you and for everybody on the channel (even if they are not using Taut).
    Want to see an example? <a href="/markdown-links">Check it out!</a></p>
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Generate hangout urls %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Want to invite somebody to a hangout? <a href="/hangout-links">I find that generating a link</a> is easier and faster than the alternatives.</p>
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Unread count on the title %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Sometimes (well, all the time) I'm on a tab that is not Slack. When that happens all I see is an asterisk on the title when there are some unread messages. Taut can <a href="/unread-count">add a count of unread messages on the page title</a>.</p>
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Move reactions to the right %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Reactions are an amazing way of providing feedback without writing... but they can take lots of vertical space. If you <a href="/styling-updates#move-reactions-to-the-right">move them to the right</a> they no longer do!</p>
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Threads on channel by default %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Do you wish replies defaulted to "Send to #channel"? Taut <a href="/reply-to-channel">can do that for you</a>.</p>
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Make "send to channel" sticky %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Once you send a reply to the channel, by default Slack unticks the checkbox for your next message. Taut can <a href="/reply-to-channel">keep your last message's selection</a> if you want it to.</p>
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Disable Google Drive previews %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Google Drive previews are great, but they take lots of vertical space. Taut can <a href="/disable-previews">replace these previews with the document url</a>, so that you can click on it if you wish.</p>
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Disable url previews %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Url previews... the times they provide any useful information for me are extremely rare. That's why Taut can <a href="/disable-previews">totally disable them</a>.</p>
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Hide the status emojis %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">And last but not least, in order to decrease the noisiness of your workspace, Taut can <a href="/styling-updates#disable-status-emojis">hide everyone's status emojis</a>.</p>
