<p class="stacks-copy">Here's a quick list of all the features. Follow the links for details on what they do :) Originally, I recorded a video showing the extension, but keeping it updated was really challenging.</p>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Smart Threads %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">I hate missing conversations just because I'm not all the time with my eyes on Slack, and this happens a lot when people decide to talk in threads. Once the initial message gets out of my view, if people keep interacting in a thread, I have no way of knowing. <a href="/smart-threads">Refined's Smart Threads</a> fix that for you.</p>
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Mute users %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Do you have some noisy bots you'd like to mute? <a href="/mute-users">Refined lets you do that</a>.</p>
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Use markdown links %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">You can write things like <span class="ff-mono">[Check this amazing extension](https://refined.chat)</span> and that's going to appear as <a href="https://refined.chat">Check this amazing extension</a> for you and for everybody on the channel (even if they are not using Refined).
    Want to see an example? <a href="/markdown-links">Check it out!</a></p>
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Generate hangout urls %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Want to invite somebody to a hangout? <a href="/hangout-links">I find that generating a link</a> is easier and faster than the alternatives.</p>
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Unread count (on the title and/or favicon) %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Sometimes (well, all the time) I'm on a tab that is not Slack. When that happens all I see is an asterisk on the title when there are some unread messages. Refined can <a href="/unread-count">add a count of unread messages on the page title</a>. And if you use it pinned, you can <a href="/unread-count-favicon">add it to the favicon</a>.</p>
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Move reactions to the right %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Reactions are an amazing way of providing feedback without writing... but they can take lots of vertical space. If you <a href="/styling-updates#move-reactions-to-the-right">move them to the right</a> they no longer do!</p>
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Avoid opening the app when clicking on a link a Slack %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">When you click on a link to a Slack message, by default it opens the Slack app (or shows a prompt). Refined lets you remove that... so that whenever you click on a link, it's always opened on the Slack web.</p>
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Disable Google Drive previews %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Google Drive previews are great, but they take lots of vertical space. Refined can <a href="/disable-previews">replace these previews with the document url</a>, so that you can click on it if you wish.</p>
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Disable url previews %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Url previews... the times they provide any useful information for me are extremely rare. That's why Refined can <a href="/disable-previews">totally disable them</a>.</p>
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Hide the status emojis %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">And last but not least, in order to decrease the noisiness of your workspace, Refined can <a href="/styling-updates#disable-status-emojis">hide everyone's status emojis</a>.</p>
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Threads on channel by default %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Do you wish replies defaulted to "Send to #channel"? Refined <a href="/reply-to-channel">can do that for you</a>.</p>
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Make "send to channel" sticky %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Once you send a reply to the channel, by default Slack unticks the checkbox for your next message. Refined can <a href="/reply-to-channel#make-reply-to-#channel-sticky">keep your last message's selection</a> if you want it to.</p>
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Move the sidebar to the right %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Refined can also <a href="/move-sidebar">move the sidebar to the right</a>.</p>
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Show details when switching channels %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Would you like to see the channel context when switching to it? Refined can also <a href="/show-channel-details">do that for you</a>!</p>
