<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Why would you want to reply to the channel by default? %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">I think that hiding conversations into a thread by default encourages conversations in private... so I'd rather have it be the default and then opt out of it manually.</p>
    <p class="stacks-copy">On this group, I placed two features: reply to #channel by default and make reply to #channel sticky (so that whatever you chose, that value is preserved for future messages).</p>
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Reply to #channel by default %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">When this feature is selected, the first message you send on a conversation is going to have the "reply to #channel" checkbox checked.</p>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Make reply to #channel sticky %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">After sending a message on a thread to the channel, this feature keeps the checkbox selected.</p>
