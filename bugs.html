<p class="stacks-copy">Unfortunately, as Refined is highly coupled with Slack's current implementation... if they update certain things of their app, Refined will break. Also, Refined may break Slack for you.<p>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | You're breaking my Slack! what can I do? %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">The first thing you can do is disable particular features until you see Slack work again. Once you identify the feature that's breaking Slack, let me know!</p>

    {% header h3 | You're not listening, I need Slack to work now! %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Ooops... sorry... uninstall or disable the extension to fix it right away. Right clicking on the extension's icon should be an easy way to disable it on any browser.</p>
