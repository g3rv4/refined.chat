and see what's going on."

    {% header h2 | What problem does this solve? %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Siloed conversations. When people talk in threads, only those who have interacted with the
        conversation get a notification... and the rest of the team either click on the conversation link or totally
        miss it.</p>
    <p class="stacks-copy">When people talk on a thread I haven't interacted with (and especially if the original
        message is outside the main window) I can't really tell that a conversation is happening at all. This plugin
        makes it as if all the people talking on your current channel chose to send their threaded messages to the
        channel.</p>
    <p class="stacks-copy">This is particularly important in teams that work across timezones. When I start my day, I
        want to go back in time and see what people talked about. If they do so in threads, I need to either click and
        read those messages on the 2nd pane (and that's if they didn't talk in a thread that's older... I have no way of
        seeing that conversation).</p>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | How does it solve it? %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">By treating all the thread messages as if they were broadcasted (that is: as if the author
        had decided to send it to the channel). To make it less noisy, it removes some elements included on broadcasted
        messages.</p>
    <p class="stacks-copy">Before:</p>

    <p class="stacks-copy">After:</p>
    <img src="/assets/images/smartThreadsAfter.png" />
    <p class="stacks-copy mt16">And to quickly identify related messages, when you hover over a threaded message, all the related
        messages are highlighted... so that you don't <i>need</i> to expand the thread to see what people are talking
        about.</p>

    {% header h2 | How does it look? %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Here's a gif showing it... check out how the messages in the same conversation get
        highlighted as the mouse moves.</p>

    {% header h2 | How does it affect your Slack experience? %}
    <ul>
        <li class="stacks-copy">All the messages people send to a thread appear on the main channel.</li>
        <li class="stacks-copy">You won't be able to tell when somebody chooses to broadcast a message to the channel.
            Broadcasted messages look exactly the same as non-broadcasted messages for you.</li>
    </ul>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | How does it affect other people's Slack experience? %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Nothing changes for them. They see threaded messages hidden behind the threads, and only
        those where the author chooses to broadcast in the channel. They won't see your messages on the main channel
        unless you choose to broadcast them.</p>
