    {% header h2 | Why would you want the count on the favicon? %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">You may be wondering why this is a thing (in addition to <a href="/unread-count">unread messages on the title</a>)... and the reason is that I pin tabs. When I do, I like to know what's going on. But I couldn't pin the Slack tab because I wouldn't know if I had unread messages (their icon doesn't really show a state other than "there are unread messages somewhere" or "you were mentioned").</p>
    <p class="stacks-copy">When this plugin is enabled, the favicon shows the number of unread messages on the channel you have selected.</p>

    {% header h2 | How does it look? %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Here's a gif... keep an eye on the pinned tab. I don't looove how it looks, so if you know how to play with canvas and make it nice, I'd love your help! <a href="https://github.com/g3rv4/Refined/blob/5e53bde13876b1a066d99c139e2f017f9deffd13/src/plugins/unreadOnFavicon.ts#L66-L77">here you can see how I'm building it</a>.
