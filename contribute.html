    {% header h3 | Understanding the plugins structure %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">If you want to contribute with the extension, keep in mind it's plugin-based. All the features are plugins so that they can easily be disabled by the user. If a feature breaks (because Slack changed something on their end) a user should be able to disable that feature in particular and that should solve the issue.</p>
    <p class="stacks-copy">The extension is written in TypeScript and the plugins can be found on the plugins folder. They can choose to observe DOM elements, intercept XHR and WS messages, and communicate with the extension.</p>
    <p class="stacks-copy">The existing plugins should (hopefully) provide a guide on how you can implement your own... but feel free to open an issue and we can discuss if I should add some documentation.</p>
